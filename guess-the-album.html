                        <h3>Album 1</h3>

                        <p>Microscopic soundscapes applied to dramatic and sensual electronic pop balladry. The vocalist's intimacy to the microphone is apparent throughout the twelve tracks totalling fifty-six minutes. While some may deem it boring or overly reliant on a sonic gimmick, the tiptoeing instrumentation and unconventionally structured songwriting sticks the landing. A classic of turn-of-the-millennium electronica.</p>

                        <p>The figurehead of jazz's most celebrated family comes through with an absolute slam dunk of a spiritual odyssey. Their instrumental chops are at the fore of the short runtime's weaving passages, with the B-side of the LP a grand highlight in the 60s jazz canon. Their descendants would go on to make waves in late 00s/early 10s wonky but those roots began to grow back when the family were a true jazz five-bagger.</p>

Iconic fashion adorned this king of the axe as he flew the flag for summer-of-love hippies wanting to rock out and freak out. An astounding riffmaker that inspired millions.</p>

                        <p>It's the late 70s, punk rock has taken over but these artful social commentators have a different medium. The class structure is fucked, we're all stuck in it but pretty soon we'll be dead anyway. Either totally insufferable or a fan favourite, depending on your disposition. The legacy of this band is matched by few, as is their commercial success. One for the die-hards, or those amenable to trippy, droney dirges.</p>
